 Text-based RPG game project
 
 This is an RPG game project initially done for my C++ course. Since I am a game enthusiastic and had a lot of free time. I wanted to improve it and make it something I'm proud about. The game is about a polarized society where you need to pick a side and destroy everything from the other side, not considering feelings, ethic, and forgiveness. For me, it represents the way our politics are today. It is something that upsets me everyday and I hope to open people's eyes with this.
